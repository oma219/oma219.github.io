## TRAC Writing Fellow - Lehigh University

I worked as a [TRAC Writing Fellow](https://trac.web.lehigh.edu/content/trac-writing-fellows-program) from August 2016 to May 2019 while being a student at Lehigh University. A TRAC Fellow is assigned to section of students in a course, and they assist the students through feedback and one-one meetings to help improve the student's communication skills. Typically, we worked with student's on their writing assignments. 

In addition, while being a TRAC Fellow, I helped to [push an initiative](https://ltsnews.lehigh.edu/trac-fellows-obs-peer-learning) to expand the TRAC program to assist students to make tutorial videos as a way to help teach other students in their course. Many of these videos can be viewed on the [YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK1WiIS-h5BdkugnAGbA05Q/about) for the project.

## Peer Leader for Organic Chemistry - Lehigh University

I mentored students in Organic Chemistry as a Peer Leader from August 2017 to May 2018. The responsibilites of a Peer Leader were to lead a small group of students during the recitation each week of the semester. Each week, students would have a packet of problems to work on, and I would assist them to understand the concepts covered in those problems.

## Volunteer at Lehigh Valley Hospital

I volunteered at the Lehigh Valley Hospital each week for three summers during my undergraduate degree. My volunteering consisted of a couple different jobs including assisting pharmacists with the delivery of medicine, and helping families entering the emergency room to find their loved ones.
