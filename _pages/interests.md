I enjoy watching and playing various sports including soccer, tennis, basketball, and football. I am a big Real Madrid fan (as you can see by the image), which is a soccer team that plays in La Liga in Spain. I also enjoy watching soccer from leagues across Europe such as Bundesliga, Premier League, and the Champions League. 

In terms of other sports, I am fan of Lebron James in the NBA and, Roger Federer in the ATP tour. And I try to play these sports whenever I can since I enjoy plus they are great exercise!

## Travel

In terms of travel, I really enjoy going to theme parks like Disney and Universal when I have the chance. I particularly like the Epcot park in Walt Disney World where you get to experience a little flavor of many countries all in one place. Plus, they have great food in all of those parks!
