## Efficient Quantification of Coverage in BigWigs, BAMs, and CRAMs

When dealing with high-throughput sequencing data, many genomic analyses typically start by looking at the data in certain key regions of the genomes such as genes or regulatory elements. Megadepth is a tool that was developed by [Christopher Wilks](https://github.com/ChristopherWilks). I assisted in the benchmarking of megadepth when comparing against other state-of-the-art tools. Our experiments show that megadepth was faster and more memory efficient that other tools across various types of data analysis.
